## Plans for business development

Many developers coming to the organization may have clients of their own. They may choose to bring their clients over to the agency or keep them separate. In addition, new clients would be solicited via the ordinary agency's ordinary practices.

Some of the incentives for bringing clients into the agency include

* availability of coworker input for ideas, architecture, code reviews, and quality assurance, etc.
* access to shared resources including test servers and licensed developer tools.
* project continuity should the project be transferred to another team.

A target _average_ billing rate will be determined democratically, and that should inform individual project fees.
