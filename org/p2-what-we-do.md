## What We Do

For web apps and services, we can provide full-service development for the whole product's lifecycle, from requirements gathering
and wireframes, to production deployment and maintenance. But our primary focus is the maintenance of legacy applications.
We remember the cross-compatibility requirements of the _First Browser Wars_. We have lived through upheavals due to the
discontinuation of support for legacy technologies, and we know how to make the necessary adjustments to ensure software
longevity.

 We have years of experience with
* Conversion of legacy HTML to modern cross-browser HTML5
* VBScript to JavaScript
* Microsoft Access to SQL Server
* Browser-specific vanilla JavaScript to jQuery's cross-browser DOM
* Classic ASP to ASP.NET
* ASP.NET Web Forms to MVC
* VB to C#
* HTML or Web Forms into single-page apps with Ajax and web services
* WCF or ASMX to Web API
* Inline SQL to stored procedures, or an entire DAL to Entity Framework

And when keeping code in the same framework:
* Unraveling spaghetti code to improve maintenance and readability
* Conversion of procedural top-to-bottom code into an object-oriented architecture
* Consolidation of code duplicates into reusable code/modules/classes/functions
* Division of code into appropriate tiers
* Adding unit tests where once there were none

Our most valuable services involve the implementation of process improvements and continuous-integration methods:
* Implementing a Git source-control strategy
* Implementing TeamCity and SonarQube for automated builds and testing.
