# Small constitution

The organization is a cooperative worker-directed agency. Decisions typically made by an owner, CEO, or board of directors made up of owners and managers will instead made democratically by all those whose livelihoods and well-being depend directly on the business and who directly contribute to the production of the surplus.

At first, all decisions will be made by a vote of everyone in the company. If it ever gets large enough that it becomes impractical for everyone to participate _directly_ in _every_ decision, the cooperative _may elect_ to delegate certain individuals to represent them, democratically, in a board of representatives. Such individuals would serve a limited term, on rotation. Though multiple terms may be allowed, there will be a limit to how many can be held consecutively. The workers as a whole will choose which decisions should be made together and which should be delegated.

## Rule of management

Unlike other organizations, there will never be a time when there are development managers who don't actually write code. We will say right now: this is hereby forbidden in our constitution. Developers may rotate between writing code, QA, project management, and DevOps. But they will always rotate back into development.
