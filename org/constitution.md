# Small constitution

The organization is a cooperative worker-directed agency. Decisions typically made by an owner, CEO, or board of directors made up of owners and managers will instead made democratically by all those whose livelihoods and well-being depend directly on the business and who directly contribute to the production of the surplus.

Democracy is a central value for modern civilization. But our local and national elections in modern democracies only give us limited input into the actual running of things. We may elect our leaders, or our electoral college may do so, but can't really keep our leaders in line, and they often end up fighting for the interests of a powerful few rather than their own constituents. Beyond this, democracy doesn't really happen in our communities and workplaces. Most workers are subservient to their managers and owners. If they attempt to unionize or otherwise make their voices heard, they risk getting fired or passed over for promotions.

In contrast, a worker-directed cooperative would directly involve the collaborative efforts of all employees to build the company and run it democratically.

At first, all decisions will be made by a vote of everyone in the company. If it ever gets large enough that it becomes impractical for everyone to participate _directly_ in _every_ decision, the cooperative _may elect_ to delegate certain individuals to represent them, democratically, in a board of representative directors made up of _surplus-producing workers_, so that decisions dealing with the appropriation of the surplus are made by those who produce it*. Such individuals would serve a limited term, on rotation. Though multiple terms may be allowed, there will be a limit to how many can be held consecutively. The workers as a whole will choose which decisions should be made together and which should be delegated.

## Rule of management

Unlike other organizations, there will never be a time when there are development managers who don't actually write code. We will say right now: this is hereby forbidden in our constitution. Developers may rotate between writing code, QA, project management, and DevOps. But they will always rotate back into development.

* Enablers and faciliators, such as accountants and office managers, will also have democratic say in the running of the agency, but they aren't eligible to be elected to the board.
