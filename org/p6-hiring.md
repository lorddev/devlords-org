# Hiring

Because there is no management class and all producing employees are directors, the hiring of new employees must be agreed on by all.

The members will hold elections for new hires.  Regular policy meetings will help determine the nature of these elections, for example:

* Is a simple majority is enough to warrant a new hire, or should it be unanimous?
* Do we have to sit together in a room to discuss a hire or can we use an anonymous Google Form?

Likewise, no member can directly fire another.  As new situations arise, members should hold meetings to determine what the policies should be regarding termination.
