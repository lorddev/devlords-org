# Hiring

Because there is no management class and all producing employees are directors, the hiring of new employees must be agreed on by all.

The members will hold an election for new employees and will also determine whether a simple majority is enough to warrant a new hire.

Likewise, no member can directly fire another. Future elections will be held to determine what the appropriate methods of termination should be.
