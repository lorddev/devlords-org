# devlords: an open-source cooperative software development agency
The documents contained herein are intended to be an open-source constitution for a democratic cooperative of software
developers.
As part of a worker-directed cooperative, agency members will have equal say as stakeholders in a company that we direct
together, rather than working for the for the benefit of a small group of executives. This repository is where we will
hash out the details to make that work.

## Project structure

Source code for the charter documents is contained in Markdown files. "Releases" will be packaged in HTML and PDF and
deployed using the "Releases" tab in GitHub. The project Wiki will serve as separate documentation describing how to
interact with _this_ documentation. Anyone can participate, so please fork and contribute.
