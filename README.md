# devlords: an open-source cooperative software development agency

The documents contained herein act as a constitution of sorts for a democratic cooperative of software developers.  Rather than working for the benefit of a small group of executives, agency members will have equal say as stakeholders in a company that we direct together.

## Project structure

Source code for the charter documents is contained in Markdown files. "Releases" will be packaged in HTML and PDF and deployed using the "Releases" tab in GitHub. The project Wiki will serve as a separate document. All are encouraged to participate, so please fork and contribute.
