# devlords open-source co-op

The documents contained herein act as a constitution of sorts for a democratic cooperative of software developers. Rather than "working for the man" agency members will have equal say as stakeholders in a company that we direct together as equals.

## Project structure

Source code for the constitution is contained in Markdown files. "Releases" will be packaged in HTML and PDF. The project Wiki will serve as a separate document. All are encouraged to participate, so please fork and contribute.
